# Secure-File-Sharing-System-Using-Image-Steganography-And-Cryptography-Techniques

In this project, we aim to create a Application where in users can 
hide their file data in any image of their choice. The main goal of this 
project is to embed textual information into a image file and also the text 
information is encrypted so we also get the advantage of cryptography. 
The Application consists of two major parts namely the encoding part and 
the decoding part. In the encoding section a user can input the image of 
his choice into which the user text information is encoded. The text 
information is also encrypted before encoding it into the image, the user 
can then download the encoded image. In the decoding section the user 
can input the decoded image and the decrypted text information is 
displayed to the user in a new file.
